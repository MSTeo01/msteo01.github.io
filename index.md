## About Me

Nice to meet you! I'm Ming Senn, a data analyst from Malaysia.

I'm a Data Science graduate from the University of California, Berkeley -- find out more about my course [here](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/dsus/academics/data-science-major). I am looking for full time roles in Singapore, the United Kingdom, or Australia.

It was 2020 when I first read an [article](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7498239/) about how the pandemic has drastically affected the environment in a positive light. Little did I know, this literature would inspire me to delve deeper into the messy, yet beautiful world of data and its intricacies.
